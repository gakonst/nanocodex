# Harbor-first OpenAI harness

## Goal

Build a thin Rust coding harness for the current best OpenAI model and API,
without a TUI, provider abstraction, approval system, or backwards compatibility.
The public process surface is JSONL on stdin/stdout. Harbor owns benchmark task
isolation, verification, result storage, and ATIF.

## Architecture

```text
development                       evaluation

task.start                        Harbor job YAML
    |                                  |
cargo run                         task container
    |                                  |
JSONL stdout                      upload Rust binary
                                       |
                                  run in /app
                                   |       |
                                OpenAI   tools
                                       |
                                    verifier
```

The Python `BaseInstalledAgent` integration is only a lifecycle adapter:
upload one static executable, run it headlessly, retain JSONL, and derive ATIF.
Rust performs API calls and tools directly inside the task container.

Local artifacts are built by a native-architecture Linux BuildKit container.
Cargo `dev` is the default; `HARNESS_BUILD_PROFILE=profiling` selects an
optimized profile with full symbols. Hosted jobs will eventually fetch a
versioned, digest-verified artifact instead of requiring the source tree.

## JSONL contract

Every event has this envelope:

```json
{"protocol_version":1,"request_id":"...","seq":1,"type":"...","payload":{}}
```

Initial input is `task.start`. Output includes `run.started`, model events,
`tool.call`, `tool.result`, assistant messages, metrics, and exactly one
`run.completed` or `run.failed`. Stdout is flushed JSONL; diagnostics are stderr.
Raw streams are authoritative and ATIF is derived from them.

## Milestone 0: installed-agent eval baseline

Status: complete.

- Clap `run` command and native `just run`.
- Cached native Linux artifact build without rebuilding task images.
- Harbor-native YAML selecting Terminal-Bench `fix-git`.
- Thin InstalledAgent upload/run adapter with no tool bridge.
- Rust shell call and canonical assertions producing reward `1`.
- Raw input/events/stderr plus valid ATIF retained per trial.
- Content-addressed native eval image with verifier dependencies baked once.

Measured on the development machine:

- native `just run`: about 0.27 seconds warm;
- real source-edit artifact rebuilds: about 2 seconds steady state;
- Harbor environment startup: about 1.2 seconds warm;
- Harbor agent upload/setup: about 0.4 seconds;
- Rust positive-control execution: about 0.1 seconds;
- unchanged canonical assertions: about 0.9 seconds;
- full Harbor trial: about 3.6 seconds warm;
- full `just eval`, including the cached agent build: about 6.7 seconds warm.

The first run after task, platform, or eval-image changes also builds the
content-addressed native image. Keep that cold setup cost separate from warm
source-edit measurements.

## Milestone 1: OpenAI execution

Status: first real model/tool vertical slice complete.

1. Call the Responses API WebSocket endpoint from Rust and preserve every raw
   inbound and outbound API event.
2. Target `gpt-5.6-sol` directly; do not add a provider interface.
3. Expose shell exclusively through hosted Programmatic Tool Calling. Do not
   provide a direct function-call fallback or run generated JavaScript locally.
4. Preserve program caller linkage, execute independent nested calls
   concurrently, and return typed structured outputs to the hosted runtime.
5. Prefer server-managed conversation state, compaction, prompt caching, and
   hosted multi-agent orchestration where the current API supports them.
6. Keep stable instructions/tools in the cacheable prefix and task-specific
   content late. Record model, effort, cache, tokens, cost, latency, tools,
   retries, and compactions in JSONL/ATIF.

Gate: at least one Terminal-Bench task completes with a real OpenAI-driven tool
loop, canonical reward, raw API events, and trustworthy usage/timing metadata.

Gate achieved twice on Terminal-Bench `fix-git`. The final regression run earned
reward `1.0` with 9 model calls, 8 PTC shell calls, 29.5 seconds inside Rust,
and 35 seconds of Harbor runtime. It used 24,186 input tokens (17,712 cached),
4,546 cache-write tokens, and 1,086 output tokens. The benchmark task and
verifier were not modified.

## Milestone 2: eval-driven tuning

Use Harbor as the runner and result store. Establish a fixed Terminal-Bench
slice covering investigation, editing, compilation, and long tool output, then
compare changes with repeated attempts. Report reward alongside p50/p95 wall
time, tool time, tokens, cache utilization, and cost. Add private taste or
regression tasks only after the public baseline is stable.

## Milestone 3: review provenance

Only after useful model-produced diffs exist, add a narrow `jj-lib` timeline:
baseline the workspace, checkpoint coherent mutation batches, and link each JJ
change to the prompt and exact JSONL sequence interval that caused it. Do not
add a second event journal, WAL, artifact graph, or hunk index first.

## Milestone 4: graders and review loops

After checkpoint links work, add verifier/grader subagents, bounded autoresearch
loops, user-defined taste constraints, and hunk-oriented human review. Reuse an
existing UI only if it cleanly exposes trace links; keep the CLI as the control.

## Deferred

- TUI work.
- Provider/model abstraction and backwards compatibility.
- Local multi-agent scheduling where hosted orchestration suffices.
- Approval and policy machinery.
- Durable replay, a parallel journal, or content-addressed artifact storage.
- Large mock-heavy unit-test suites ahead of working end-to-end behavior.

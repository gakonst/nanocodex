# Secure Vault intake and website approval

`request_vault_intake` renders an inline card in managed web and iPhone/iPad chat.
The card opens a client-owned form. Login passwords, API keys, card values,
addresses and phone numbers are submitted directly to the authenticated Vault
endpoint, never as conversation or tool arguments. Only an allowlisted saved
receipt is sent back into the original conversation. Closing the form or changing
accounts discards its input. Unknown save outcomes are not automatically retried.

For an existing login without a website binding, request
`{ operation: "authorize_origin", kind: "login", vault_id, origin }`.
The form retrieves the actual saved item's name, displays the exact HTTPS website,
and updates only `browser_origin`; the user does not reenter the password. Approval
replaces the prior website binding. There are no wildcard or subdomain grants.
Legacy entries remain usable for their existing HTTP Vault operations, but private
browser login requires website approval.

Account-session mutations retain same-origin protection. Native Vault forms use
persistent account API keys with `agents:write` and `tools:use`; Connect grants,
anonymous accounts and read-only keys cannot mutate Vault. Website approval and
Vault resolution use the current account's broker. The browser-only materialization
RPC is reachable through the managed service binding, never model HTTP egress.

## Disabled legacy browser integration

Managed `browser_execute` and all `browser_vault_*` agent tools are disabled.
Browser interaction now uses the selected Hand's CUA MCP provider. Secure Vault
intake and website approval remain available, but they do not authorize exposing
secrets to CUA code. Automated Vault login requires a supported private CUA
integration.

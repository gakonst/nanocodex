# Nanocodex development

- `macos/` owns the desktop app and native tiled workspace; `js/desktop-runtime`
  owns its runtime. `apple/NanocodexInbox` targets iPhone and iPad.
- `js/nanocodex` and `js/nanocodex-react` are public contracts. Cover changes
  with relevant contract, type, package, and runtime checks.
- `js/nanocodex-vite` owns the Vite plugin, WASM build, OAuth relay, and
  Cloudflare Vite integration.
- Apps and Workers deploy independently. Shared behavior belongs in a package,
  consumed through its public API.
- Use root `pnpm` scripts and existing Turbo/Portless/Vite/Wrangler tooling.
  Deploy dependencies first and `account` last. Component deploy scripts build
  their dependencies from a clean checkout. See [README.md](README.md) for setup.
- Verify changed behavior in the relevant runtime. Prefer focused tests at
  policy and protocol boundaries and end-to-end evidence for product journeys.
